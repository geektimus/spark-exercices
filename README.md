# Spark Exercises

This project contains the solutions to some basic exercises using Spark.

The initial idea was to practice some strategies when solving a wide variety of problems
processing small sets of data using **Scala**, **Apache Spark** and **SBT**

## Exercises

1. Find the total expenses per users.
2. Group friends by age.
3. Get the minimum temperature on a set of measures on 1800.
4. Find the most popular hero.
5. Find the top 10 most popular movies.
6. Count the number of ratings per movie.
7. Find the degrees of separation between Heroes (without GraphX)
8. Find similar movies based on the rating history by user.

## Notes

- This repo will be merged with [Spark-Training](https://github.com/geektimus/spark-training)
when I add all the unit test for this exercises since all the code on that project was 
unit tested.

- This repo will be updated from time to time because I need to get used to SBT. I like it
but It takes too many resources.
